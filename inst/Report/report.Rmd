## Cost-effectiveness analysis 
The cost-effectiveness analysis is based on the maximisation of the expected utility, defined as the _monetary net benefit_ $nb_t=ke_t-c_t$. Here $t$ indicates one of the interventions (treatments) being assessed, while $(e,c)$ indicate the relevant measures of _effectiveness_ and _cost_. For each intervention, the expected utility is computed as $\mathcal{NB}_t=k\mbox{E}[e_t]-\mbox{E}[c_t]$. When comparing two interventions (say, $t=1$ vs $t=0$), or using a pairwise comparison, we can determine the ``best'' alternative by considering the difference in the expected utilities $\mbox{EIB}=\mathcal{NB}_1-\mathcal{NB}_0$. This can also be expressed in terms of the _population effectiveness and cost differentials_  $\mbox{EIB}=k\mbox{E}[\Delta_e]-\mbox{E}[\Delta_c]$, where $\Delta_e=\mbox{E}[e\mid\bm\theta_1]-\mbox{E}[e\mid\bm\theta_0]$ and $\Delta_c=\mbox{E}[c\mid\bm\theta_1]-\mbox{E}[c\mid\bm\theta_0]$ are the average effectiveness and cost, as function of the relevant model parameters $\bm\theta=(\bm\theta_0,\bm\theta_1)$.

This sub-section presents a summary table reporting basic economic results as well as the optimal decision, given the selected willingness-to-pay threshold $k=`r wtp`$. The table below presents a summary of the optimal decision, as well as the values of the Expected Incremental Benefit $\mbox{EIB}=k\mbox{E}[\Delta_e]-\mbox{E}[\Delta_c]$, Cost-Effectiveness Acceptability Curve $\mbox{CEAC}=\Pr(k\Delta_e-\Delta_c)$ and Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio $\mbox{ICER}=\displaystyle\frac{\mbox{E}[\Delta_c]}{\mbox{E}[\Delta_e]}$, for the set willingness-to-pay value.

## Cost-effectiveness plane
The following graph shows the cost-effectiveness plane. This presents the joint distribution of the population average benefit and cost differential, $(\Delta_e,\Delta_c)$ and can be used to assess the uncertainty underlying the decision-making problem. 

Each point in the graph represents a 'potential future' in terms of expected incremental economic outcomes. The shaded portion of the plane is the '_sustainability area_'. The more points lay in the sustainability area, the more likely that the reference intervention will turn out to be cost-effective, at a given willingness to pay threshold, $k$ (in this case selected at $k=$ `r wtp`)

```{r, echo=FALSE,fig.width=4.6,fig.height=4.6,fig.align=align,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,comment=NA}
n.ints <- m$n.comparators
if (n.ints==2) {graph="base"; pos=c(1,1)} else {graph="ggplot2"; pos=TRUE}
ceplane.plot(m,graph=graph,pos=pos,wtp=wtp)
```

## Expected Incremental Benefit
The following graph shows the Expected Incremental Benefit (EIB), as a function of a grid of values for the willingness to pay $k$ (in this case in the interval `r min(m$k)` - `r max(m$k)`). 

The value for $k$ in correspondence of which the line crosses the $x-$axis is termed the '_break-even point_' and represents the point(s) at which the optimal decision changes. The graph also reports the 95% credible limits around the EIB.


```{r, echo=FALSE,fig.width=4.6, fig.height=4.6, fig.align=align,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,comment=NA}
#fig.cap="The Expected Incremental Benefit as a function of the willingness-to-pay",
n.ints <- m$n.comparators
if (n.ints==2) {graph="base"; pos=c(1,1)} else {graph="ggplot2"; pos=TRUE}
eib.plot(m,graph=graph,pos=pos)
```

## Cost-effectiveness efficiency frontier
The Cost-Effectiveness Efficiency Frontier (CEEF) compares the net costs and benefits of different interventions in a given therapeutic area. It is different from the comon differential approach (eg based on the Cost-Effectiveness plane), beacuse it is based on the _net_ measures. The predicted costs and effectiveness for the interventions under consideratino are compared directly to the costs and effectiveness for the treatments that are currently available. The frontier in itself defines the set of interventions for which cost is at an acceptable level for the benefits given by the treatment. A new intervention is _efficient_ if its average effectiveness is greater than any of the currently available alternatives, or its cost are lower than that associated with other interventions of the same effectiveness.

In the following plot, the circles indicate the mean for the cost and effectiveness distributions for each treatment option. The number in each circle corresponds to the order of the treatments in the legend. If the number is black then the intervention is on the efficiency frontier. Grey numbers indicate dominated treatments. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, comment=" ", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=4.6, fig.height=4.6,fig.align=align,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,comment=NA}
n.ints <- m$n.comparators
if (n.ints==2) {graph="base"; pos=c(1,1)} else {graph="ggplot2"; pos=TRUE}
ceef.plot(m,graph=graph)
cat()
```

The summary is composed of two tables, reporting information for the comparators included on the frontier. It also details the average health effects and costs for the comparators not on the frontier, if any. For the interventions included on the frontier, the slope of the frontier segment connecting the intervention to the previous efficient one and the angle inclination of the segment (with respect to the $x-$axis), measured in radians, are also reported. In particular, the slope can be interpreted as the increase in costs for an additional unit in effectiveness, \ie the ICER for the comparison against the previous treatment. For example, the ICER for the comparison between Self-help and No treatment is \pounds$176.01$ per life year gained. 

The dominance type for comparators not on the efficiency frontier is reported in the output table. This can be of two types: absolute or extended dominance. An intervention is absolutely dominated if another comparator has both lower costs and greater health benefits, \ie the ICER for at least one pairwise comparison is negative. Comparators in a situation of extended dominance are not wholly inefficient, but are dominated because a combination of two other interventions will provide more benefits for lower costs. 

## Cost-effectiveness acceptability curve
The following graph shows the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC). The CEAC represents the proportion of 'potential futures' in which the reference intervention is estimated to be more cost-effective than the comparator. Thus, it can be interpreted as the 'probability of cost-effectiveness'.

Bayesian Cost Effectiveness Analysis

Given the results of a Bayesian model (possibly based on MCMC) in the form of simulations from the posterior distributions of suitable variables of costs and clinical benefits for two or more interventions, produces a health economic evaluation. Compares 
one of the interventions (the "reference") to the others ("comparators"). Produces many summary and plots to analyse the results
